# SEP740: Deep Learning - Project 12: FIFA Player Value Prediction
This repository is for the SEP740 Final Project. The group conducting this project was Group 1 in section C02. The choosen project was Project 12: FIFA Player Value Prediction.

# Overview
FIFA player market value prediction would enable football franchises to make informed business decisions regarding signing players, offering contract extensions, as well as participating in the transfer market.

# Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a Deep Learning model that accurately predicts a player's market value. This will entail the pre-processing of the dataset, developing a neural network model as a performance baseline, performing hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating the results.

# Setup
To execute the code with the provided dataset from Kaggle, simply run it. No additional steps are required to setup the dataset, as functions have already been integrated within the code to deal with any setup.

# Results and Conclusion
The results and discussion of this project involve the following components:

Baseline ANN trained model results
Hyperparameter tuned model training and testing results
Evaluation of the hyperparameter tuned model using visualization techniques
